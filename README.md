# GFG_Emission_Prediction
We have annual supply chain emission data from 2010-2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/ geographical/ technological/ data collection correlations, etc.)
